By PZ Client i mean files that are avaiable in \steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid

Books XP multiplayer is here:
\media\lua\server\XpSystem\XPSystem_SkillBook.lua

XP Granting to player is here:
\media\lua\server\XpSystem\XpUpdate.lua (some interesting str/fitness loosing xp)

Video/Tapes:
\media\lua\shared\RecordedMedia\recorded_media.lua 
\media\lua\client\RadioCom\ISRadioInteractions.lua
  codes="RCP+1" in lines mean what operation should ISRadioInteractions do (\media\lua\client\RadioCom\ISRadioInteractions.lua)
  first 3 signs (ex. RCP) means which statistic should change. Fourth sign determines operation (if amount should be added or removed). Fifth sign determines amount of change.
  I think this is how game "give" xp to player when watching it.
